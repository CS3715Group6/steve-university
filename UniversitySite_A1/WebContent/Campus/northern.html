		<h1>About Steve University Northern Campus</h1>
		<div id="student_data">

		</div>
		<p>
			<span class="university">SUNC</span> is an urban-serving university providing access to students in a way 
			that transforms families and communities. We impact and inform economic development 
			through community-engaged students and faculty. We conduct research that is of direct 
			use to our community and region. And, most importantly, we seek to be connected to our 
			community’s needs and aspirations.<br><br>
			
			Set in the historic Steve Station District, SUNC owes its charm to century-old, 
			brick buildings that were built to last by businesses that depended on the railroad 
			in the late 1880s and early 1900s. The university has earned architectural awards for 
			transforming these buildings into modern classrooms. In the design of its beautiful 
			campus, SUNC honors the traditions of the Northern Pacific Railroad and its 
			part in establishing Steve as the City of Destiny.<br><br>
			
			The 46-acre campus footprint is located on a hillside overlooking the Port of Steve 
			and Mount Unicorn, on the southern edge of downtown Steve, next to museums 
			and the beautifully reconstructed Steve Station. Within walking distance are 
			an array of restaurants, attractions, businesses, shops, parks, museums and 
			historic architecture.<br><br>

			SUNC is accredited as a unit of the Steve University by 
			the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

			<h2>Students</h2>
			<p>
	        	<span class="university">SUNC’s</span> diverse student body includes a broad range of ethnic and family 
	        	backgrounds, ages, interests and experience. More than 80 percent of students 
	        	transfer to SUNC from one of the many community colleges in the area or from 
	        	other universities. Freshmen from high schools all over the Puget Sound and beyond 
	        	make up a growing portion of students. Add to the mix students who are returning to 
	        	school after years away, military personnel and their families, and professionals 
	        	working on new career goals. Our students create a kaleidoscope of perspectives 
	        	crucial to learning.		
			</p>
			<h2>Learning</h2>
			<p>
				At <span class="university">SUNC</span>, students learn in small classes, getting to know their faculty while

				core curriculum, which blends different fields of study into interdisciplinary classes. 
				Courses might mix art and ecology, or business and social science. 
				The result is a rich learning environment where students are encouraged to challenge 
				themselves. 
			</p>
			<h2>Community</h2>
